# community-program

## Overview
UnUniFi is a community-driven project, and we need you to help grow our ecosystem. We have created an open community program where every community member can join and support the UnUniFi ecosystem.   
You can collect points and receive rewards if your contributions are valid. And joining the community program as a community member is the perfect way to show us that you are the Ambassador we need for the UnUniFi ecosystem.   
It’s also an ideal way to educate yourself about UnUniFi and the Cosmos ecosystem.   

The community program consists out of two tracks:   

**Community rewards**: help UnUniFi to grow the ecosystem and get rewarded for your contributions.

## Reward/point system

### Rewards
Every month 40,000 GUU Token from the community pool will be used as rewards. And these rewards will be distributed amongst our Ambassadors and community members based on their contributions on Github. The amount of distributed GUU will be posted at the end of each month after mainnet launch.   
And, the POAP (Proof of Attendance protocol) like NFT will be distributed at the same time of GUU distribution for any proper community program applicants.   
But, the initial POAP NFT distribution will be occurred on our beta-testnet with the feature to mint NFTs on UnUniFi.

### Points
We have created 10 categories and each category has a point range.   
Based on different parameters you receive points. Your rewards and how it’s calculated will be shared in your contribution on Github.
